You will need DRM, pciaccess, cpufreq and wxwidgets libraries to compile the project.
Code::Blocks and wxFormBuilder project files are included.
Also, you can use "make" to build.

Makefile has three arguments; debug (default off) , amdgpu (default on) , deskfile (default off).
example:

`make` equals to `make debug=0 amdgpu=1`

To install gnome desktop shurtcut, set deskfile=1 while installing proccess.
Be root and run;

make deskfile=1 install
