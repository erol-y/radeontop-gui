You will need DRM, pciaccess and wxwidgets libraries to compile the project.
Code::Blocks and wxFormBuilder project files are included.
Also, you can use "make" to build.

"make" has two arguments; debug (default off) and amdgpu (default on).
example:
"./make" --> equals to "./make debug=0 amdgpu=1"
