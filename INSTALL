You will need DRM, pciaccess, cpufreq and wxwidgets libraries to compile the project.
In terminal, type;
sudo apt-get install libpciaccess-dev libcpufreq-dev libdrm-dev libwxgtk3.0-dev

Code::Blocks and wxFormBuilder project files are included.
Also, you can use "make" to build.

Makefile has three arguments; debug (default off) , amdgpu (default on) , deskfile (default off).
example:

`make` equals to `make debug=0 amdgpu=1`

To install gnome desktop shurtcut, set deskfile=1 while installing proccess.
Be root and run;

make deskfile=1 install

There will be two executable files at usr/sbin :
radeontop-gui.v1 => Compiled (main) file
radeontop-gui    => Script (helper) file

Type `radeontop-gui -h` to see usage.
